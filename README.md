Automated measurement of incomplete hippocampal inversion

1. Orient to AC/PC or similar

1. Identify the coronal section (select ~3rd slice posterior of body/head interface)

1. Identify most medial and most lateral voxels of subicular complex, compute distance between

1. Identify most medial and most lateral voxels of dentate gyrus, compute distance between

1. Final metric will be difference (or ratio?) of the two distances
